# Nitro getRequestURL unexpected value

I utilized a Nuxt app as a reproduction. You should be able to see where I am attempting to retrieve and store the origin and hostname via `getRequestURL` in `/server/middleware/set-origin.ts`

I'm fully aware I _could_ be missing something obvious or intended, so if this is the case, I'd greatly appreciate some help in understanding what's going on.
